The most common are apartments, detached houses, and townhouses. Other types of residential facilities include: condominiums, co-ops, dormitories, group homes, manufactured homes, and RV parks.</p>
<p>Apartments are the most commonly found type of residential facility. They are typically multi-story buildings with a number of units. The units may be studios, one-bedroom, or two-bedroom units. Most apartments have a shared living space, such as a living room and kitchen, and at least one bathroom. Some apartments also have a balcony or patio.</p>
<p>Detached houses are single-family homes that are not attached to any other homes. They usually have a yard and driveway for parking. Detached houses come in a variety of sizes and styles, from small starter homes to large luxury homes.</p>
<p>Townhouses are similar to detached houses but they are attached to other townhouses in a row. Townhouses usually have less space than detached houses because the walls between each unit share common walls. This can make them cheaper to buy and maintain than detached houses.</p>
<p>Condominiums are multi-unit buildings where each unit is owned individually rather than rented from a landlord. In many cases, the owner also owns the exterior surface area of the building (such as the walls and roof). Condominiums typically have a shared living space, such as a lobby or garden, and each unit has its own bedroom(s), kitchen(s), and bathroom(s).</p>
<p>Co-ops are buildings where each resident owns a share in the building itself rather than an individual unit within the building. In most cases, residents must be approved by the co-op board before purchasing a unit in the building. Co-ops usually have shared living spaces such as lobbies, gardens, or roof decks. They also often have shared amenities such as gyms or swimming pools.</p>
<p>Dormitories are buildings where students live while attending school away from home. They typically offer inexpensive housing options for students and come furnished with all of the basics needed for living (e.g., bedding, kitchenware, etc.). Dormitories can be on campus or off campus.</p>
<p>Group homes are residences where individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities live together as part of a supportive community setting. These homes offer communal dining areas, recreational spaces, and staff support during waking hours The staff work to create opportunities for socialization and independence for the residents living in these homes.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-Assisted-Living"><a href="#What-is-Assisted-Living" class="headerlink" title="What is Assisted Living?"></a>What is Assisted Living?</h1><p>In simple terms, assisted living is a type of care for seniors who need help with some activities of daily living but do not require hospital-level care. Supportive services and assistance with activities such as bathing, dressing, grooming, and managing medications may be provided in assisted living communities.</p>
<p>Assisted living communities come in all shapes and sizes. Some cater to those who are relatively independent but still need some assistance, while others provide more comprehensive support for individuals with more significant needs. The cost of assisted living also varies widely, depending on the level of care offered.</p>
<p>One key advantage of assisted living is that it allows seniors to age in place, which can be important for both psychological and practical reasons. Residents can maintain their independence and social connections while receiving the support they need.</p>
<p>There are many different types of assisted living communities, but they typically share some common features. Here are just a few:</p>
<p>24/7 staffing: Assisted living communities have staff on duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This ensures that residents always have access to help when they need it.</p>

<h1 id="What-is-a-Nursing-Home"><a href="#What-is-a-Nursing-Home" class="headerlink" title="What is a Nursing Home?"></a>What is a Nursing Home?</h1><p>A nursing home, also known as a skilled nursing facility (SNF), is a type of care facility for older adults who need 24-hour nursing care and supervision due to an illness or injury. Nursing homes offer both long-term and short-term care.</p>
<p>The most common residents of nursing homes are people over the age of 85, but nursing homes also provide care for younger adults with disabilities, such as cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, and intellectual disabilities.</p>
<h1 id="What-Services-Does-a-Nursing-Home-Offer"><a href="#What-Services-Does-a-Nursing-Home-Offer" class="headerlink" title="What Services Does a Nursing Home Offer?"></a>What Services Does a Nursing Home Offer?</h1><p>A nursing home can provide residents with both medical and non-medical services. Medical services include wound care, medication management, intravenous therapy, and respiratory therapy. Nursing homes also offer social and recreational activities, such as arts and crafts classes, movie nights, bingo games, and group outings to local attractions.</p>
<h1 id="How-Much-Does-It-Cost-to-Stay-in-a-Nursing-Home"><a href="#How-Much-Does-It-Cost-to-Stay-in-a-Nursing-Home" class="headerlink" title="How Much Does It Cost to Stay in a Nursing Home?"></a>How Much Does It Cost to Stay in a Nursing Home?</h1><p>The cost of living in a nursing home varies depending on the location of the facility and the level of care required by the resident. The average monthly cost for a private room in a nursing home is $6,844 nationwide. The average monthly cost for a shared room is $5,539.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-differences-between-Residential-Facilities-Assisted-Living-and-Nursing-Homes"><a href="#What-are-the-differences-between-Residential-Facilities-Assisted-Living-and-Nursing-Homes" class="headerlink" title="What are the differences between Residential Facilities, Assisted Living, and Nursing Homes?"></a>What are the differences between Residential Facilities, Assisted Living, and Nursing Homes?</h1><p>When a loved one can no longer live safely at home, families have to decide what type of care is best. This decision can be difficult because it often involves a trade-off between the level of care required and the level of independence desired by the older person. The three most common types of long-term care facilities are Residential Facilities, Assisted Living, and Nursing Homes.</p>
<p>Residential Facilities provide 24-hour care in a home-like setting. This type of facility is typically for people who need extensive help with activities of daily living, such as bathing, dressing, and using the toilet. They may also need help with meals and medication.</p>
<p>Assisted Living Facilities offer a higher degree of independence than Residential Facilities, but still provide some level of assistance with activities of daily living. These facilities usually have staff on site around the clock, but residents are allowed to come and go as they please. Assisted Living Facilities usually have their own kitchen where residents can cook their own meals or eat at a communal table.</p>
<p>Nursing Homes provide the highest level of care, including personal care assistance, nursing services,and medical oversight. Most residents in Nursing Homes require around-the-clock supervision due to significant health problems.</p>
<h1 id="Are-there-any-other-types-of-Residential-Facilities-that-I-should-know-about"><a href="#Are-there-any-other-types-of-Residential-Facilities-that-I-should-know-about" class="headerlink" title="Are there any other types of Residential Facilities that I should know about?"></a>Are there any other types of Residential Facilities that I should know about?</h1><p>Long-term Residential Care Facilities: </p>
<p>These facilities provide care for elderly individuals who are not able to live independently. They offer assistance with activities of daily living, such as bathing, grooming, and dressing. These facilities also provide meals, social activities, and transportation.</p>
<p>There are two types of long-term residential care facilities: nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Nursing homes provide more intensive care than assisted living facilities. They typically have more staff members on duty and offer 24-hour nursing care. Assisted living facilities offer more independence than nursing homes. They typically have fewer staff members on duty and do not offer 24-hour nursing care.</p>
