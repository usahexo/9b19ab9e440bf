        <h1 id="Arkansas-Governor-Signs-Slot-Machine-Bill-Into-Law"><a href="#Arkansas-Governor-Signs-Slot-Machine-Bill-Into-Law" class="headerlink" title="Arkansas Governor Signs Slot Machine Bill Into Law"></a>Arkansas Governor Signs Slot Machine Bill Into Law</h1><p>Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson has signed into law a bill that will legalize slot machines at the state’s racetracks.</p>
<p>The new law, which was overwhelmingly approved by the Arkansas legislature, authorizes the Arkansas Racing Commission to issue up to 1,500 slot machine licenses. The licenses will be available to the state’s two racetracks, Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs and Southland Park Gaming Resort in West Memphis.</p>
<p>In a statement released after he signed the bill into law, Governor Hutchinson said he was “pleased to sign this legislation that provides a new stream of revenue for our racetracks and creates jobs.” He added that the new law would also “benefit our economy by attracting additional tourists to our state.”</p>
<p>Oaklawn Park officials say they plan to have the slot machines up and running by the end of the year. Southland Park Gaming Resort has not yet announced when it will begin offering slots.</p>
<h1 id="Arkansas-Legislature-Passes-Gambling-Bill"><a href="#Arkansas-Legislature-Passes-Gambling-Bill" class="headerlink" title="Arkansas Legislature Passes Gambling Bill"></a>Arkansas Legislature Passes Gambling Bill</h1><p>After much debate, the Arkansas Legislature has passed a bill that would allow for gambling in the state. The bill, which was proposed by Governor Asa Hutchinson, would allow for casino gambling, as well as sports betting. The bill has been sent to the House for approval, and is expected to be signed into law.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill argue that it will bring much-needed revenue to the state. Gambling is already legal in neighboring states such as Louisiana and Mississippi, and they argue that Arkansans are spending their money there instead of at home.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that gambling can be addictive and lead to financial ruin. They also argue that it could lead to increased crime rates and social problems.</p>
<p>Governor Hutchinson has said that he is confident that the House will pass the bill, and he is optimistic about its chances in the Senate as well.</p>
<h1 id="Arkansas-Casino-Bill-Signed-Into-Law"><a href="#Arkansas-Casino-Bill-Signed-Into-Law" class="headerlink" title="Arkansas Casino Bill Signed Into Law"></a>Arkansas Casino Bill Signed Into Law</h1><p>Arkansas has now become the latest state to legalize casinos after its casino bill was signed into law by Governor Asa Hutchinson. The new measure will allow for up to four casinos to be built in the state, with one each in Pine Bluff, Russellville, Hot Springs, and West Memphis.</p>
<p>Governor Hutchinson commented on the bill signing, saying that it would be a “game changer” for Arkansas. He also noted that the measure would create jobs and generate revenue for the state.</p>
<p>The bill’s passage has been met with criticism by some who argue that it will lead to increased crime and gambling addiction. However, supporters of the measure argue that it will bring much-needed economic development to Arkansas.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the new casinos could generate as much as $200 million annually in revenue for the state. The casinos are expected to open in 2021.</p>
<h1 id="Bill-to-Authorize-Slot-Machines-in-Arkansas-Passes-Legislature"><a href="#Bill-to-Authorize-Slot-Machines-in-Arkansas-Passes-Legislature" class="headerlink" title="Bill to Authorize Slot Machines in Arkansas Passes Legislature"></a>Bill to Authorize Slot Machines in Arkansas Passes Legislature</h1><p>HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) – A bill that would allow casinos in Arkansas has passed the state Legislature.</p>
<p>The bill, which would allow up to four casinos in the state, now goes to Gov. Asa Hutchinson for his signature. The Republican governor hasn’t indicated whether he will sign it into law.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill say it would create jobs and generate revenue for the state. Opponents argue that it could lead to gambling addiction and other problems.</p>
<p>If the bill is signed into law, Arkansas would become the latest Southern state to allow casino gambling. Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee all have casinos.</p>
<p>Arkansas has struggled in recent years to close a budget shortfall. In March, Hutchinson signed a measure that raised taxes on cigarettes and cigarettes products and broadened the sales tax to include digital items such as music and videos.</p>
<h1 id="Arkansas-Moves-Closer-to-Legalizing-Slot-Machines-with-Passage-of-Gambling-Bill"><a href="#Arkansas-Moves-Closer-to-Legalizing-Slot-Machines-with-Passage-of-Gambling-Bill" class="headerlink" title="Arkansas Moves Closer to Legalizing Slot Machines with Passage of Gambling Bill"></a>Arkansas Moves Closer to Legalizing Slot Machines with Passage of Gambling Bill</h1><p>Arkansas is one step closer to legalizing slot machines after the passage of a gambling bill on Thursday. The bill, which was approved by the state House of Representatives, now moves on to the Senate for further consideration.</p>
<p> Slot machines are currently legal in Arkansas, but they can only be operated in casinos that are owned by Native American tribes. The new bill would allow any qualified business owner in the state to operate slot machines. This would include establishments such as restaurants, truck stops, and bowling alleys.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill argue that it will generate much-needed revenue for the state. They point to studies that show that states with legalized gambling have seen increased tourism and tax revenue. Opponents of the bill, however, argue that it will lead to increased crime and addiction rates.</p>
<p>The Arkansas Senate is expected to take up the bill in the coming weeks. If it is approved, it will then go to Governor Asa Hutchinson for his signature.</p>
