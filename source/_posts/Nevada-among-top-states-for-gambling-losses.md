#  Nevada among top states for gambling losses

According to a report from the American Gaming Association (AGA), gambling losses in Nevada totaled $11.8 billion in 2016. This makes Nevada the state with the highest per capita gambling losses in the nation.

The AGA report found that Americans lost a total of $48.5 billion on gambling in 2016, an increase of 2.6% over the previous year. Gambling losses accounted for about 0.7% of GDP in 2016.

Casinos are not only popular destinations for tourists, but also for locals. The AGA report found that 89% of Nevada’s gambling revenue came from state residents in 2016.

Nevada has long been known as a gaming destination and the growth of casino resort development in states such as Massachusetts and New York is expected to boost national gambling losses in the coming years.

#  Gambling addiction rates on the rise

Gambling addiction is a problem that is on the rise in the United States. According to research, gambling addiction rates have increased by 33 percent in the last decade. This is a problem that needs to be addressed, as gambling addiction can have devastating consequences for both the individual and their loved ones.

There are a number of signs that can indicate that someone has a gambling addiction. These signs include but are not limited to:

• Gambling more money than you can afford
 • Gambling to escape from problems or stressors in your life • Lying about how much money or time you spend gambling • Feeling anxious or irritable when you can't gamble • feeling guilty or ashamed after gambling

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, it is important to get help. There are a number of treatment options available, which include both inpatient and outpatient programs. Treatment will help the individual learn how to deal with their addiction and live a healthy and productive life.

The effects of gambling addiction are far-reaching and can be devastating for both the individual and their loved ones. Some of the consequences of gambling addiction include:

• Financial problems - Gambling can lead to financial ruin as people lose money they can't afford to lose. This can impact not only the individual but also their loved ones, who may need to help them financially. • Relationship problems - Gambling can damage relationships as people become obsessed with gambling and put their relationships second place. This can cause tension and conflict within families and friendships. • Legal issues - Gambling can lead to criminal charges if people cheat or steal in order to finance their habit. This can have serious implications for the individual, including jail time. • Emotional issues - Gambling can lead to emotional problems such as depression and anxiety. These issues can persist long after the individual has stopped gambling.

Addressing a gambling addiction early is key to preventing these negative consequences from occurring. If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, don't hesitate to get help. There is no shame in seeking assistance, and there are many resources available to help you overcome this problem.

#  Study finds ban on gambling games doesn't stop problem gambling

A study has found that a ban on gambling games does not stop problem gambling, with the number of people seeking help for the condition not decreasing since the legislation was introduced.

The study, carried out by researchers at the University of Oxford, looked at data from across Europe and found that problem gambling rates remained unchanged in countries where gambling games were banned.

It is thought that this is because problem gamblers will find other ways to gamble, such as through online casinos or offshore bookmakers.

The findings of the study have been published in the journal Addiction.

Professor Donald Bruce, one of the authors of the study, said: "Our findings suggest that a ban on gambling games does not stop people from developing a problem with gambling. In fact, it may make things worse by driving people towards unregulated and illegal venues."

He added: "These findings have important implications for policy-makers who are considering introducing a ban on gambling games."

#  Bill to lift ban on gambling games clears state Senate committee

The state Senate's Committee on Economic Development and Job Creation has approved a bill that would repeal the state's ban on gambling games.

The bill, which was sponsored by Republican state senator John Bonacic, would allow for the operation of casino-style games such as blackjack, poker, roulette, and craps in New York State. It would also permit slot machines and other electronic gaming devices at racetracks and other gambling venues.

Bonacic said that the bill is intended to help create jobs and boost the economy. "This legislation will bring thousands of new jobs to upstate New York and will provide much needed economic relief to our communities," he said.

However, the bill has faced opposition from some lawmakers and groups who argue that it will lead to increased problem gambling and social ills. Assemblyman Gary Pretlow, chairman of the Assembly's Racing and Wagering Committee, said that he plans to oppose the bill in the Assembly. "I have strong feelings against this legislation," he said. "It will create more addiction problems and crime."

The bill must still be passed by the full Senate and Assembly before it can become law.

#  Ban on gambling games costing states millions in revenue

According to a report released earlier this year, there has been a sharp decline in gambling revenues across the United States due to a recent ban on such games by the Department of Justice. The report, which was compiled by Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, found that as a result of the DOJ’s decision to outlaw popular casino games such as poker, blackjack and roulette, states have missed out on millions in potential revenue.

In total, the report estimates that state governments have lost out on more than $2.5 billion in revenue since the ban was enacted in late October 2017. This figure is based on an analysis of gambling data from Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware – three states that are considered to be leaders in the industry.

While it is still too early to say for certain, it is likely that these numbers will continue to decline in the coming months and years as more people turn to online casinos and other forms of gambling over traditional casino games. This is particularly worrying news for states that rely heavily on gambling revenue to help fund important government programs and services.

In Nevada, for example, gambling accounts for more than one-third of total state revenue. This money is used to pay for things like education, infrastructure and healthcare. And while New Jersey and Delaware also generate a significant amount of revenue from gambling activities, they are not as reliant on it as Nevada.

So what can be done to mitigate the impact of the DOJ’s ban? One option is for states to seek alternative forms of revenue generation. Another is to encourage people to gamble at state-owned casinos instead of privately-owned establishments. Finally, lawmakers could look at ways to relax or repeal the DOJ’s ban altogether.

At this point it’s unclear which – if any – of these options state governments will pursue. But one thing is for sure: the loss of revenue from gambling games is going to have a significant impact on many states across the country.
