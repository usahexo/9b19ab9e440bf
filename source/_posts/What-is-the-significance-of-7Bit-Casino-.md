#  Why are the Baltimore Orioles Aren't performing as expected?

There is no question that the Baltimore Orioles have not been meeting expectations this season. After a Wild Card victory in 2016 and an 85-win season, Baltimore was supposed to be a contender in the tough American League East. However, they currently sit at 24-32, good for last place in the division. So, what has gone wrong?

One big reason is the team's performance at the plate. They are batting just .240 as a unit, which ranks 27th in MLB. This is particularly surprising given that they have stars like Manny Machado and Chris Davis in their lineup. Another major issue has been their starting pitching. Baltimore's starters have an ERA of 5.06, which is third worst in MLB.

So, what needs to change for the Orioles to turn things around? One possibility is that they need to make some outside acquisitions before the trade deadline. They could use help both in the batting lineup and on the mound. Another possibility is that some of their current players need to start performing better. In particular, Machado and Davis need to start hitting like the All-Stars they are supposed to be.

Whatever changes Baltimore makes, they need to do it soon. The Orioles are currently 7 games out of first place and 3 games out of last place. If they don't start playing better soon, they will find themselves out of playoff contention altogether.

#  How will the loss of Dickenson affect the Orioles?

The Orioles loss of their offensive coordinator, Gary Dickenson, to the Detroit Lions after 4 seasons is surely a big one. But how will it specifically impact the team?

Dickenson was responsible for much of the Orioles offensive success in recent years. He helped developed young stars such as Manny Machado and Chris Davis, as well as working extensively with veteran slugger AdamJones. His play-calling abilities were highly praised, and he was able to get the most out of his players. Without Dickenson, the Orioles offense may struggle to produce at the same level as they have in recent seasons.

This is not to say that the Orioles are a one-man show. Manager Buck Showalter is one of the best in baseball, and he will undoubtedly do his best to fill the hole left by Dickenson. However, it is unlikely that anyone can replicate Dickenson's success. The Orioles offense may take a step back this season as a result of his departure.

#  What do Orioles fans think about the team this year?

The Orioles came into the 2018 season with a lot of optimism from their fan base. After all, the team made it to the postseason in 2016 and 2017. However, the Orioles have been struggling this year and are in last place in the American League East Division.

So what do Orioles fans think about the team this year? There is a range of opinions, but most fans seem to be disappointed with how the season has gone so far. Some fans are even calling for manager Buck Showalter to be fired. Others are still hoping that the team can turn things around and make a run at the postseason.

Overall, it seems that Orioles fans are not happy with how the season has played out so far, but they are still hopeful that things can improve.

#  What is causing the low attendance at Oriole games?

A recent study conducted by the Baltimore Sun revealed that the main reason for the low attendance at Oriole games is the high ticket prices. The study showed that, on average, Orioles fans earn less than the fans of any other team in baseball. This could be due to the fact that Baltimore is a blue-collar town and its residents are not as wealthy as those in other cities.

In addition to the high ticket prices, another reason for the low attendance is the lack of winning seasons by the Orioles in recent years. The team has not made it to the playoffs since 1997 and has only had two winning seasons in the last 10 years.

Another problem that has been contributing to the low attendance is the stadium itself. Oriole Park at Camden Yards is one of the oldest stadiums in baseball and it does not have many of the modern amenities that fans have come to expect. For example, there are no luxury suites or club seats in the stadium, and there is very little shade available throughout its seating areas.

The Orioles organization has been aware of these problems for some time now and they have been trying to address them. In 2012, they announced a plan to build a new $535 million stadium that would include luxury suites and club seats. However, this plan has been met with resistance from Baltimore city officials, who say that they cannot afford to pay for it. As a result, it is unclear whether or not this new stadium will ever be built.

In spite of these problems, there are still some things that Orioles fans can do to improve attendance at games. One thing is to try and get tickets through Ticketmaster or StubHub, rather than buying them directly from the team. Another thing is to bring friends or family members with you to games, as this will increase overall attendance numbers. Finally, you can also support the team by attending special promotional events, such as bobblehead nights or fireworks shows.
