#  3 aces and 2 kings – What are the odds?

The following anecdote highlights the improbability of being dealt three aces and two kings in poker.

In 2002, a man named Mike McDermott (not to be confused with the character from the movie Rounders) was playing in a casino in Atlantic City when he was dealt three aces and two kings. McDermott bet $10,000 on the hand and won $1,000,000. The odds of being dealt this particular hand are astronomical – 1 in 650,740,068.

So what are the odds of being dealt any particular hand? Well, that depends on the number of cards in the deck and the number of different ways those cards can be arranged. For example, if there are 52 cards in the deck and there are six different ways to arrange those cards (e.g., A♠2♥3♦4♣5♠6♦), then the odds of being dealt any particular Poker hand are 6/52 or 1/9.

However, as the number of cards in the deck increases, so do the odds of being dealt a particular hand. For example, if there are 192 cards in the deck and there are 12 different ways to arrange those cards (e.g., A♠2♥3♦4♣5♠6♦7♥8♦9♥10♥J♥Q♥K♥), then the odds of being dealt any particular Poker hand are 12/192 or 1/16.
