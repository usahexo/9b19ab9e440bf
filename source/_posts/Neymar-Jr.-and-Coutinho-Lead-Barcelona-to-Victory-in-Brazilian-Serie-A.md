#  Neymar Jr. and Coutinho Lead Barcelona to Victory in Brazilian Serie A

Barcelona began their Brazilian Serie A campaign with a convincing 3-0 victory over Chapecoense. Neymar Jr. and Philippe Coutinho were both on the scoresheet for the Blaugrana, as they continue their impressive form since the latter’s arrival from Liverpool.

Despite some early pressure from Chapecoense, Barcelona took the lead in the 28th minute when Neymar Jr. curled in a superb free-kick. The hosts doubled their advantage just before halftime, as Coutinho finished off a flowing team move.

The scoring was completed in the second half, as Neymar Jr. set up Paco Alcacer to make it 3-0. This win sees Barcelona open up an early three-point lead at the top of the table, as they aim to recapture the title they lost to Cruzeiro last season.

#  Roberto Firmino Leads Liverpool to Top of the Table

Liverpool have had an excellent start to the season, and it all started with Roberto Firmino. The Brazilian has been in inspired form, scoring 5 goals and providing 4 assists in just 9 Premier League games. Liverpool currently sit top of the table, and they have Firmino to thank for their good form.

Most strikers would be happy with 5 goals and 4 assists, but Firmino isn't most strikers. The 25-year-old is a midfielder by trade, and he likes to get involved in the build-up play as well as the final third. This makes him a difficult player to defend against, as he can hurt you in both areas.

Liverpool's next game is against Manchester United, and they will need Firmino at his best if they are to get a result. United have been in good form themselves this season, and they will be looking to take advantage of Liverpool's poor defensive record. But with Firmino leading the charge, Liverpool have every chance of getting a result at Old Trafford.

#  Gabriel Jesus and Manchester City Stay on Top

Gabriel Jesus and Manchester City continue to lead the Premier League after beating Burnley 3-0. The 21-year-old Brazilian striker scored two goals in the first half and set up the third for Leroy Sane, as City maintained their perfect start to the season.

Jesus has now scored eight goals in all competitions this season, with six of them coming in the Premier League. He has also assisted three goals, making him an important part of Pep Guardiola's attack.

"Gabriel is so important," Guardiola said after the game. "He makes a difference. We are very happy with him."

After a tough start to life in Manchester following his move from Palmeiras last January, Jesus is starting to show his quality for City. He has formed a deadly partnership with Sergio Aguero and looks set to lead the club's attack for years to come.

City have been impressive so far this season, winning all six of their Premier League games. They also reached the quarter finals of the Carabao Cup with a 5-1 win over Championship side Leeds United on Tuesday night.

Guardiola will be looking to win his first Premier League title with City this season and Jesus will be a key player in their bid for glory.

#  Juventus and Cristiano Ronaldo Dominate Italian Serie A

Cristiano Ronaldo’s stunning start to life at Juventus continued over the weekend as he scored his eighth Serie A goal of the season in a 2-0 win over Lazio. Ronaldo has now found the net in each of his last eight league appearances for Juve and is well on course to break the all-time goalscoring record in Italy.

The Bianconeri have been utterly dominant in Serie A this season, winning all 10 of their matches so far to open up an 18-point lead at the top of the table. Ronaldo has played a major role in their success, scoring crucial goals against Sassuolo, Parma and Lazio in recent weeks.

Juventus are now unbeaten in their last 36 league games, a run which stretches back to April 2018, and they look certain to lift their eighth consecutive Serie A title this season. With Ronaldo leading the attack, they will be confident of going even further and winning Europe’s top prize for the first time since 1996.

#  Sao Paulo Struggles as Teams Push for the Top

The Sao Paulo club, one of the most successful clubs in Brazil, has been struggling in the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A (the Brazilian first division), with teams at the top of the table pushing for the title.

Sao Paulo are currently in seventh place in the league, having accumulated 33 points from 25 games. Their record so far this season is eight wins, six draws, and eleven losses. This is a far cry from their performance last year, when they finished in second place in the league, behind only Cruzeiro.

One of the main reasons for Sao Paulo’s struggles this year has been their poor attacking form. They have scored just 30 goals in 25 matches, which is the lowest tally in the top eight teams in the league. This lack of firepower has been costly, as they have conceded 31 goals – more than any other team in the top eight.

In order to turn their fortunes around, Sao Paulo need to start scoring more goals and tightening up defensively. They have some talented players capable of doing both of those things, such as Lucas Moura and Alexandre Pato. If those players can start firing on all cylinders, then there is no reason why Sao Paulo cannot finish in a Champions League qualification spot by the end of the season.
