#  Quickspin Develops New Technology to Cash Out on Wild Online Casino Slots 

Quickspin, a Sweden-based slot game developer, has announced the launch of a new technology that will allow players to cash out on winning spins in their online casino games. The new Cash Out feature is designed to provide a simpler and more convenient way for players to collect their winnings without having to wait for the game to end or go through a withdrawal process.

The Cash Out feature will be available initially in Quickspin's flagship game, Spinions Beach Party. Players who have landed a winning combination on one of the game's 25 paylines will be able to click on the "Cash Out" button to receive their payout immediately, minus any applicable fees.

"We are very excited about this new addition to our portfolio," said Daniel Lindberg, CEO of Quickspin. "The Cash Out function provides an easy and convenient way for players to collect their winnings, without having to wait for the game to end or go through a withdrawal process."

The Cash Out feature will be rolled out gradually to other Quickspin games over the next few months.

#  Quickspin CEO Announces Plans to Cash Out on Wild Online Casino Slots 

Stig Ingar Nakken, the CEO of Quickspin, has announced his plans to sell the company and cash out his share of the profits. Quickspin is a leading developer of online casino slots and its games are enjoyed by millions of players across the globe.

Nakken made the surprise announcement via a press release. He said that he feels it is time to move on to new challenges and that he is proud of what Quickspin has accomplished over the past few years.

The news comes as a shock to the online gambling community, as Quickspin is considered to be one of the most successful slots developers in the business. The company has produced some of the most popular titles in recent years, including Goldilocks and the Wild Bears, Crystal Queen and Spinions Beach Party.

Quickspin was founded in 2012 by Nakken and Mats Westerberg. The pair had previously worked together at Net Entertainment, where they helped to develop some of the first ever online casino slots.

Westerberg will remain with Quickspin as chief product officer following Nakken’s exit. He said that while he is sad to see Nakken go, he is confident that the company will continue to thrive under his leadership.

Nakken himself expressed confidence in Westerberg’s ability to lead Quickspin into its next phase of growth. He said: “Mats has been an integral part of Quickspin from day one and knows both our products and our team inside out. I am certain that he will do an excellent job in taking Quickspin forward into its next stage of development.”

It is not yet clear who will buy Quickspin or how much it is expected to fetch in sale proceedings. However, industry insiders believe that it could be valued at between $100 million and $200 million.

#  How to maximize your chances of cashing out on a wild online casino Quickspin slot machine 

There are a few simple things you can do to maximize your chances of cashing out on a wild Quickspin slot machine: 

1. Play maximum bet amounts – this will increase your chances of winning the bigger payouts. 

2. Look for machines with high RTPs – these will give you more chances of winning over the long term. 

3. Always play with bonuses and loyalty rewards – these can help increase your bankroll and improve your chances of winning.

#  Tips for taking advantage of Quickspin's new cash out feature on wild online casino slots 


1. Always be aware of when the cash out feature is available.

Quickspin has made it easy to know when the cash out feature is available. Look for the golden treasure chest symbol in the game. This symbol will appear randomly and when it does, you will have the opportunity to collect your winnings and finish playing the game.

2. Make sure you are playing at a reputable online casino.

Not all casinos offer the cash out feature from Quickspin. You need to make sure you are playing at a casino that offers this before you start playing. The last thing you want is to be in the middle of a game and have to stop because you cannot complete the game.

3. Know how much money you can win with the cash out feature. 

The amount of money that you can win with the cash out feature varies depending on the game that you are playing and your current bet amount. Generally, though, it is a percentage of your current bet amount. So, if you are betting $10 per spin and hit the cash out feature, you could potentially win $100 or more depending on the game and your bet amount.

4. Make sure you are comfortable with how much money you could lose if you do not hit the cash out feature. 

Like with any other type of gambling, there is always risk involved when playing slots games with a cash out feature enabled. If you do not hit the cash out button when it becomes available, there is a chance that you could lose all of your winnings from that spin. So, before starting any game with this feature enabled, be sure you are comfortable with losing all of your current bet amount if things go bad.
