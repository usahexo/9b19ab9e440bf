What is Baccarat?

Baccarat is a simple card game that uses a deck of 52 cards. The aim of the game is to guess whether the player or banker will get closest to nine points. Points are scored by counting the number of points on each card: ace is worth one point, 2-9 are worth face value, and 10s and court cards (jacks, queens and kings) are worth zero points. After both player and banker hands have been dealt, bettors can choose to put their money on the player, bank or tie. If you’re feeling lucky, you can even bet on a “natural” – that is, either a 9 or an 8 from either hand.

How do I Play?

At Four Noblemen Casino Dickinson, we offer both regular baccarat and mini-baccarat tables. Mini-baccarat is a simplified version of the game that uses just seven cards instead of the full deck. In both variants of the game, bets are placed before any cards are dealt, then players must decide whether to take another card (hit) or stay with their current total (stand). In regular baccarat, players can also choose to double down (double their bet and take one more card) or split (split a hand of two cards into two separate hands). As with all casino games, the house edge is built into Baccarat so it’s important to gamble wisely!

What are the Odds?

The odds depend on what bets you make but typically range from 1:1 (banker wins) to 8:1 (player wins). The odds on a tie are usually 9:1. Bets on natural pay out at 6:1.
