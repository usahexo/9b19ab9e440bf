#  Who Sounds Bingo and Bluey Malta?

Malta is an archipelago country in the Mediterranean Sea. It consists of three islands: Gozo, Comino, and Malta. The main island, Malta, is where the capital city Valletta is located. Malta is a popular tourist destination and has been inhabited since around 5200 BC.

The first known settlers in Malta were the Phoenicians who arrived in the 8th century BC. The Maltese culture is a mix of Phoenician, Roman, Arab, Norman, and British influences. Malta became a part of the British Empire in 1814 and remained a British territory until 1964 when it gained independence.

Malta's official languages are Maltese and English. However, Italian and French are also spoken by a significant portion of the population. The majority of Maltese people (83%) are Christian with a majority belonging to the Catholic Church. Muslims account for around 17% of the population, mostly living on the island of Gozo.

Malta joined the European Union in 2004 and adopted the euro as its currency in 2008. The economy of Malta is based on tourism, financial services, real estate, manufacturing, and agriculture. The country has been ranked as one of the most prosperous economies in the world and has one of the lowest unemployment rates in Europe.

Bingo and Bluey are two popular Maltese dog breeds that are often seen around the island nation. Bingo is a small spaniel-type dog that was developed in Malta during the 17th century. Bluey is a large sheepdog-type dog that was also developed in Malta during the 17th century. Both breeds are considered to be national treasures in Malta and are often used as working dogs on farms and estates.
